# Subtitulos

[Lee esto en español](README.md) |  [Leer em portugués](README.pt.md)

This repo will organize the necessary work to create subtitles for CoDeAr's videos on YouTube.

We'll be adding subtitles in three languages: Spanish, English and Portuguese.

## How can I contribute?

Leave a comment on any of our [subtitle projects](https://github.com/SomosCodear/Subtitulos/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22control+de+traducci%C3%B3n%22) letting us know you want to get involved.

## How subtitles should be created?

We'll be using the SubRip (.srt) format for all subtitles. This format's easy enough to work with and does not require any special software.
