This repo will organize the necessary work to create subtitles for CoDeAr's videos on YouTube.

We'll be adding subtitles in three languages: Spanish, English and Portuguese.

## How can I contribute?

Leave a comment on any of our [subtitle projects](https://github.com/SomosCodear/Subtitulos/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22control+de+traducci%C3%B3n%22) letting us know you want to get involved.

## How subtitles should be created?

We'll be using the SubRip (.srt) format for all subtitles. This format's easy enough to work with and does not require any special software.

## I never did subtitles before...

Don't worry! You can contribute by creating a transcription in a plani text file for someone else to pick up and convert to SubRip.

## Workflow

1) [Fork](https://github.com/SomosCodear/Subtitulos/fork) this repo.
2) Go to the directory for the language you're about to work with: 
 - If you're going to work with subtitles (SRT), create a SRT file named as the video's issue number. If you're working with the "Educar en tiempos de #YoMeQuedoEnCasa" video in English, the full path and filename is `en-US/1.srt`.
 - If you're going to work with a transcription (TXT), create a plain text file named as the video's issue number. If you're working with the "Educar en tiempos de #YoMeQuedoEnCasa" video in English, the full path and filename is `en-US/1.txt`.
3) Send a pull request, referencing the video you've worked on linking the related issue and completing all requested data.
4) CoDeAr's staff will test and check any subtitles. Once they're verified and working, the PR is approved and merged.
